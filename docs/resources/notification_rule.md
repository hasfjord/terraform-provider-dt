    range = {
      lower = 0
      upper = 30

    }
  }

## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) he display name of the rule that is visible in Studio.
- `project_id` (String) The DT project ID of the rule.
- `trigger` (Attributes) The condition that that needs to be met before the actions are executed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--trigger))

### Optional

- `actions` (Attributes List, Deprecated) The list of actions that will be executed when the trigger is met. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--actions))
- `devices` (List of String) An optional map of labels to use as a filter for which devices this rule applies to.
								This applies regardless of whether or not the devices field is set. The map can contain
								both label key/value pairs, or just label keys. If multiple labels are specified, the
								device must match all of them to be included.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether or not the rule is enabled.
- `escalation_levels` (Attributes List) A list of escalation levels that will be used throughout the lifecycle of alerts
    							that are created by this rule. The first escalation level will be used when the
    							alert is triggered, and the next escalation level will be used when the alert is
    							escalated, and so on. Each escalation level needs at least one action, and there
    							needs to be at least one escalation level. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--escalation_levels))
- `schedule` (Attributes) A schedule limits at what times the rule will be evaluated, and events will be processed. 
								When an event is received outside the schedule, the device will never be put on the delay
								queue, and a trigger counter (if enabled) will not be incremented. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--schedule))
- `trigger_delay` (String) The amount of time to wait before executing the actions. This is useful to avoid
    							sending notifications for short-lived conditions, or when a notification is only desired
    							if a condition has been met for an extended period of time (eg. fridge temp above a certain
    							value for 1h, or a door open for 30 minutes). If this is not set, the actions will be
    							executed immediately.
- `unacknowledge_after` (String) The amount of time before an acknowledged alert created by this rule is unacknowledged.
								When an alert is unacknowledged, the notifications for its current escalation level
								will be sent out once again, and the escalation timer will start. The default value
								is 4 hours.

								A possible expansion is to add this field to each escalation level as well. This would
								override the value set here, and allow for different unacknowledgement times for different
								escalation levels. This increases complexity, and should only be added if there is a clear
								use case for it.

### Read-Only

- `name` (String) The resource name of the rule. The resource name has the following format: "projects/{project_id}/rules/{rule_id}". 
							 	The name is ignored when creating a new rule.
- `reminder_notification` (Boolean) Whether or not to send a reminder notifications
- `resolved_notification` (Boolean) Whether or not to send a resolved notifications

- `range` (Attributes) The range of values that the data field has to be within or without for the criteria to be met. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--trigger--range))

Read-Only:

- `trigger_count` (Number) The number of times a device has to meet the trigger criteria (enter triggering mode) 
											before a notification is published. The value has to be greater than 1 for this feature
											to be "enabled". A value of 0 or 1 is considered equivalent.
